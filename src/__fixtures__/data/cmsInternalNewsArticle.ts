This early and continual focus on Guardians helped the team understand Space Force personnel’s preferences on topics such as connecting easily to frequently used websites or applications, news & events, frequently accessed forms, and staying up to date on military requirements, to name a few.',

Our agile delivery method helps the team effectively prioritize features and which problems to tackle (and in what order). If we find ourselves suddenly moving in an unhelpful direction, agile also allows us to make quick course corrections based on direct Guardian feedback. Our team has found that putting Space Force personnel at the center of our decision-making helps build not only a better product, but also helps build trust in government services.',
